        üèóÔ∏è This project is a work in progress. Currently you can score a game of
        Dutch Blitz, but more features are coming. The idea is to create a stats
        tool for people who are <i>really</i> into{" "}
        <a href="https://dutchblitz.com/">Dutch Blitz</a>. Note: all players are
        currently global, meaning that when you sign-up, your email address will
        be visible to other users. Adding a friends mechanism is high on the
        list
