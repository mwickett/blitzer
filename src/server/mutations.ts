/**
 * This file has been refactored to improve maintainability.
 * All server actions have been moved to the mutations/ directory
 * and organized by domain.
 *
 * This file now explicitly re-exports each server action to maintain
 * backward compatibility with existing imports.
 *
 * Note: In "use server" files, we must explicitly export each async
 * function instead of using "export * from".
