# Product Context for Blitzer

## Business Context & Rationale

Dutch Blitz is a fast-paced, highly interactive card game with a dedicated player base. While the gameplay is enjoyable on its own, the experience has traditionally been ephemeral â€“ once a game ends, all statistics and insights are lost. Blitzer exists to transform these fleeting gameplay moments into persistent, analyzable data, enabling players to:

- Track their performance over time
- Understand their strengths and weaknesses
- Compare their stats with friends and the broader community
- Discover patterns in their gameplay that would otherwise remain hidden

The application fills a gap in the Dutch Blitz ecosystem by providing a digital complement to the physical game, enhancing the overall experience without changing the core gameplay.
