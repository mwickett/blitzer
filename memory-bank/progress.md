## Current Status

### Development Phase

The application is in active development with core functionality working but undergoing architectural improvements and UI refinements.

### User Adoption

- Small group of testers using the application
- Gathering initial feedback on usability and features
- Not yet promoted for broader adoption

### Performance

- Core functionality performs well
- Some areas with room for optimization:
  - Initial page load times
  - Database query efficiency
  - Client-side rendering performance

### Deployment

- Deployed on Vercel
- Connected to Neon PostgreSQL database
- CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments from main branch

## Known Issues

### Technical Issues

- Inconsistent architecture between API routes and Server Actions
- Some components need performance optimization
- Mobile responsive design issues on certain screens
- Occasional database connection timeouts on cold starts

### UX Issues

- Score entry could be more intuitive for new users
- Friend request flow needs better state feedback
- Game history lacks filtering options
