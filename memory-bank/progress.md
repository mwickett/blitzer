# Project Progress

This document tracks the overall progress of the project, highlighting what's been completed and what's still pending.

## Recently Completed

### Code Organization and Maintainability (March 29, 2025)

- âœ… Refactored `src/server/mutations.ts` into domain-specific modules:
  - Split into `games.ts`, `rounds.ts`, `friends.ts`, `guests.ts` and `common.ts`
  - Created a specialized re-export pattern for Next.js "use server" compatibility
  - Improved maintainability and organization of server actions
  - Updated tests to work with the new structure
  - Documented the new architecture in system patterns
  - Discovered and addressed Next.js restrictions around "use server" exports

## Currently Working

### Ongoing Testing and Improvements

- Ensuring tests are passing with the new architecture
- Potentially expanding test coverage for refactored server actions

## Up Next

### Further Code Organization

- Apply similar refactoring to `src/server/queries.ts` which has also grown large
- Consider extracting validation logic into more specific modules
- Look for other areas where the domain-based modularization pattern could be beneficial

### Documentation and Knowledge Transfer

- Improve documentation of server action patterns and best practices
- Update existing documentation to reflect the new architecture

## Future Considerations

### API Development

- Consider creating more explicit API boundaries between different domains
- Explore the possibility of implementing a more formal API layer

### Enhanced Error Handling

- Develop a more comprehensive error handling strategy
- Consider custom error types for different domains

## Notable Challenges

### Maintaining Backward Compatibility

- Maintaining imports during refactoring was a key challenge addressed with the barrel file pattern
- Test mocking needed to be adjusted to work with the new file structure
