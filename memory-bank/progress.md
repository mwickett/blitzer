# Project Progress

This document tracks the overall progress of the project, highlighting what's been completed and what's still pending.

## Recently Completed

### Authentication Flow and Error Tracking Improvements (May 2025)

- ✅ Implemented comprehensive error tracking for authentication flows:

  - Created standardized utilities in `src/lib/errorTracking.ts` for auth error and success tracking
  - Integrated Sentry and PostHog for complete observability of authentication events
  - Implemented user-friendly error messages based on error types
  - Added detailed documentation in `docs/auth-error-tracking.md`

- ✅ Enhanced OAuth authentication flow:

  - Improved Google OAuth sign-in and sign-up experience
  - Added dedicated `sso-callback` page with specialized error detection
  - Created `complete-username` page for OAuth sign-up completion
  - Implemented consistent error handling across all authentication components

- ✅ Standardized authentication patterns:
  - Consistent error tracking for all authentication methods
  - Unified success tracking for analytics and monitoring
  - Structured error context for better troubleshooting
  - Updated system patterns documentation

### Code Organization and Maintainability (March 29, 2025)

- ✅ Refactored `src/server/mutations.ts` into domain-specific modules:
  - Split into `games.ts`, `rounds.ts`, `friends.ts`, `guests.ts` and `common.ts`
  - Created a specialized re-export pattern for Next.js "use server" compatibility
  - Improved maintainability and organization of server actions
  - Updated tests to work with the new structure
  - Documented the new architecture in system patterns
  - Discovered and addressed Next.js restrictions around "use server" exports

## Currently Working

### Authentication Analysis and Monitoring

- Setting up monitoring dashboards for authentication success rates and errors
- Analyzing error patterns to identify potential improvements
- Collecting user feedback on the authentication experience

## Up Next

### Further Code Organization

- Apply similar refactoring to `src/server/queries.ts` which has also grown large
- Consider extracting validation logic into more specific modules
- Look for other areas where the domain-based modularization pattern could be beneficial

### Documentation and Knowledge Transfer

- Improve documentation of server action patterns and best practices
- Update existing documentation to reflect the new architecture

## Future Considerations

### API Development

- Consider creating more explicit API boundaries between different domains
- Explore the possibility of implementing a more formal API layer

### Enhanced Error Handling

- Develop a more comprehensive error handling strategy
- Consider custom error types for different domains

## Notable Challenges

### Maintaining Backward Compatibility

- Maintaining imports during refactoring was a key challenge addressed with the barrel file pattern
- Test mocking needed to be adjusted to work with the new file structure
